# CalendarSync

[My Notes](notes.md)

Enough haggling back and forth, this application helps you find out when works for you and your team! Meetings, hangouts or simply finding free time in your schedules, use CalendarSync now!


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Finding time with a team shouldnâ€™t feel like solving a puzzle. Our collaborative scheduling web app makes it simple: each member quickly drags and drops their time blocks (classes, meetings, social events, etc.) onto a personal calendar, then the app merges everyoneâ€™s schedules into one group view. The shared calendar highlights free time slots and least-busy options, so groups can effortlessly find the best time to meet without endless text threads or doodle polls. Make frustrating availability coordination a thing of the past!

### Design

The homepage describes the purpose of the website and teaches users how to use it!

The create page allows users to create a group calendar...

While the join page allows users to join existing calendars.

The calendar page offers a quick and easy way for individuals to drag and drop color coded activities onto an individual calendar, which will be compiled for their collective viewing and decision making on the group calendar.
